        The village sits in the shadow of a stone pyramid - a
        temple, according to Inlan - smaller than she described
        but fascinating nevertheless to Will. Although the existence
        of these structures is generally acknowledged, Will could find
        very little related literature in the University library.
        Heâ€™d expected as much though, given the un-enlightened attitude
        of most scholars to the so-called primitives - an attitude that

        figure looks out over the village from the highest stair on the
        pyramid, staff in hand. Imagine, if Will could be the first scholar
        to document these people, to learn their ways, to understand their
        beliefs and customs - imagine, if he could teach them Commonwealth
        values and freedoms and democratic practices and show all those other
        scholars who think them primitive that ...
